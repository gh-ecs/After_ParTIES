# after_ParTIES

This project contains software to analyze the relationships between IES (or other developmentally excised DNA) retention scores across multiple experimental conditions. A retention score correlation matrix is the output.

For detailed usage information download and run [after_ParTIES.py](https://github.com/gh-justanotheruser/After_ParTIES/blob/master/after_ParTIES.py) with the "--help" switch. 

This software was tested with Python3.6 and relevant modules for scientific computing from the Anaconda software distribution from Continuum Analytics (version: Anaconda3-4.3.1). After cloning or downloading this repository, all the depencies can be installed using conda, with the following command: `conda env create -f conda_env.yml`
